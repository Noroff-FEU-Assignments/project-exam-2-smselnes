## Summary

My final exam at Noroff is **Medi@holic**. It has been challenging, yet very interesting to work with. Its been quite a journey over the past 7 weeks. It started off with analyzing the brief well and get into the planning process. I've used Trello actively throughout the weeks to sort tasks and make priorities to my kanban board.

Most of the project has gone well. I've had a few stops where I needed to destructure the code or do some serious debugging to get past the blockers. But I've learnt a lot more in those fields through this project.

As always, the design part is difficult. I did not know the API from before, and I felt a need to get to know it before start developing, so after registering a new user in Postman, I played around to do some fetching just to understand the JSON returned. Then I could go back to the prototype to easier understand the flow of the application. This also gave me a good start on the developing process.

I've done "in-house" user testing with people not connected to the community, and I've done external user-testing with fellow students. As often before, these tests give both expected and unexpected feedback which is valuable.

All in all I'm happy with the result. There's room for improvements here and there, but all the requirements asked for are completed.
